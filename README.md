# Reinforcement Learning with CartPole-v1: A TensorFlow and Keras Example


## About the CartPole Example

The CartPole environment is a classic problem in reinforcement learning, often used as a benchmark to test algorithms. In this example, we tackle the CartPole-v1 environment from OpenAI Gym. The objective is to balance a pole on a cart by moving the cart left or right.

### Problem Description

In CartPole-v1, the environment consists of:

- A cart that can move along a frictionless track.
- A pole attached to the cart by a joint.
- The goal is to prevent the pole from falling over by applying left or right forces to the cart.

### Approach

1. **Random Environment Testing**: Initially, we test the environment by taking random actions to observe the behavior of the system.

2. **Creating Deep Learning Model**: We construct a deep learning model using Keras to learn the optimal policy for the CartPole environment.

3. **Building Agent with Keras-RL**: We utilize the Keras-RL library to build an agent that interacts with the environment, learning from experience using the deep Q-learning algorithm.

### Implementation

- The code provided demonstrates the installation of necessary dependencies, testing the environment with random actions, building a deep learning model with Keras, and training an RL agent with Keras-RL.

- Through this example, we aim to showcase how reinforcement learning techniques can be applied to solve a simple yet challenging problem like balancing a pole on a cart, highlighting the power of deep learning and RL in solving real-world tasks.
