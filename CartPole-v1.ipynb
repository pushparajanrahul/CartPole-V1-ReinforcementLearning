The model architecture consists of an input layer, two hidden layers with ReLU activation functions, and an output layer with a linear activation function. The states and actions parameters determine the input and output dimensions of the model respectively. Finally, the function returns the compiled model. The model.summary() call prints a summary of the model's architecture."
